# Clustering Algorithm Performance Visualization

This project visualizes and compares the performance of four clustering algorithms:

- DBSCAN  
- SSA-DBSCAN  
- AMD-DBSCAN  
- k-means  

The script generates:
1. A grouped bar plot that compares all algorithms across numerical metrics.
2. Individual plots for each algorithm with qualitative annotations.

## 📊 Metrics Visualized
### Numerical Metrics
- Silhouette Score  
- Noise Ratio (%)  
- Execution Time (s)

### Qualitative Metrics
- Spatial Cluster Accuracy  
- Density Handling  

These qualitative metrics are added as text annotations on each plot.
